# Credibility-Weighted Premium Modeling for Workers’ Compensation

## Overview
This project develops a two-stage actuarial pricing model for workers' compensation insurance using NCCI data across 121 occupation classes. The model combines:
1. **Frequency-Severity GLM** for baseline pure premium estimation
2. **Bühlmann Credibility Theory** to adjust estimates for low-exposure classes


## Methodology
- **Data**: NCCI workers' compensation (121 classes, 7 years, 847 observations)
